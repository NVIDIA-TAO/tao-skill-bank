## Description: <br>
Runs TAO Data Services KPI analysis for object detection, comparing inference annotations against ground truth to compute per-class TP/FP/FN/TN, precision, recall, accuracy, and AP at a fixed IoU. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>

## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers scoring object detection model predictions against ground truth to report per-class mAP after an inference run. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

Risk: The reported sequence name is derived from the image directory path rather than configured, so two KPI sources can silently collide under one name. <br>
Mitigation: The bundled spec validator rejects a trailing slash on image_dir; lay out image directories so the second-to-last path component is the intended sequence identifier. <br>

## Skill Output: <br>
**Output Type(s):** [Shell commands, Files, Analysis] <br>
**Output Format:** [Markdown with inline bash code blocks, CSV metrics] <br>
**Output Parameters:** [1D] <br>
**Other Properties Related to Output:** [None] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`claude-code`) <br>
- Codex (`codex`) <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 1 evaluation task in the NVSkills-Eval external profile (astra-sandbox environment). <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
