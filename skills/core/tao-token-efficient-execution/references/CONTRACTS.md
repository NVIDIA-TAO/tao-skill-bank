# Kit contracts — the on-disk state that replaces chat history

Every contract here exists so a fresh session (or the driver, which is plain
bash) can answer "where are we?" without any conversation memory.

## Run directory (`$RD`)

One directory per run, created under `$WS/results/`. Everything a session
learns that later sessions need MUST land in `$RD`. The driver selects the
newest run dir matching the pack's glob that is newer than its launch marker —
runs never share state.

## Progress marks — how the driver routes

Two equivalent conventions; a pack uses exactly one:

- **Simple packs** (`progress.log`): each completed stage appends one line,
  `<stage> ok` (failures append `<stage> FAIL`). The driver routes on the last
  `ok` line only — error lines never advance routing, and a trailing `FAIL`
  halts the driver (no auto-retry; an operator decides).
- **Skill-tooling packs** (`loop_log.jsonl`): when the application skill ships
  its own commit machinery (e.g. DEFT's `commit_stage.py`, which validates
  evidence before writing), ALL state writes go through it and the driver
  routes on the last `status=="ok"` entry. Cards never hand-roll state writes
  that the skill's tooling owns.

## `STAGE_DONE <card-id>` — explicit termination

Every card ends with: print exactly `STAGE_DONE <card-id>` as the final
message and stop. Measured failure this prevents: models that cannot end a
turn burn hundreds of messages per session. The harness adapter enforces a
hard tool-call budget (`PI_KIT_TURN_BUDGET`) as the backstop.

## `commands.log` — reuse, don't re-derive

The recorder adapter appends every substantive executed command (with a
timestamp) to `$RD/commands.log`. Guard-blocked commands are never recorded.
The driver injects the tail into each session's prompt; cards instruct the
executor to reuse recorded commands instead of re-deriving them. This is the
single biggest defense against small-model drift: the correct command exists,
so the model's job is to run it, not to reinvent it.

## Environment contract

Cards reference ONLY driver-exported constants (`$WS`, `$RD`, `$ITER`,
container images, mount strings, script paths). Two hard rules, both from
measured failures:

- The executor's shell is fresh per tool call — variables set in one call do
  not survive to the next. Anything that must persist is either a driver
  export or a file in `$RD`.
- Cards never contain `<placeholders>` the executor must fill by searching.
  Exact paths, exact flags, one copy-paste command per step.

Per-host values (workspace, venv, model, images) come from
`~/.tao-kit/kit.env`, sourced by every pack driver. Credentials are never
written anywhere — drivers check presence of the API key variable and abort
with the export instruction if missing.

## Driver obligations

1. **Route** on the last committed ok mark (see above), mapping stage → card.
2. **Wait** on real activity (container CPU%, runner processes), not on the
   agent — cards launch long jobs detached and end the turn. Idle zombie
   containers must not count as work (check CPU, not existence).
3. **Halt** on committed errors and on N consecutive no-progress rounds.
   Never auto-retry a committed failure.
4. **Snapshot** state into the prompt (progress tail, commands.log tail) so
   the fresh session starts with everything it needs and nothing more.
5. **Write nothing into the skill bank checkout** — sessions and driver logs
   go to `~/.tao-kit/<pack>/`.

## Guards — block dead ends before tokens burn

Guards are advisory-with-teeth: they block a tool call and return a reason
that tells the model WHY and WHAT TO DO INSTEAD. Framework guards (turn
budget, near-duplicate-command loop breaker, no-fabricated-results
verification, destructive-command safety net) ship in the adapters and are
env-configurable. Workflow guards (GPU quirks, disk headroom, container CLI
quirks) are added one per discovered failure mode — see the adapters' README
for real examples and the pattern to copy.
