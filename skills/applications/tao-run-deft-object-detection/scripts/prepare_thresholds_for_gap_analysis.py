"""Write the run's AP50 gates into a file `gap_analysis` can be given.

``init_deft_state.py`` accepts per-class AP50 thresholds, validates them, and stores
them at ``config.ap50_thresholds``. The gap spec needs them under ``weak_thresholds``,
in ``{class: {ap50: value}}`` shape, and ``apply_spec_overrides.py`` can only set a
nested block from a file. Nothing produced that file, so the documented build could not
be run and the stage fell back to the gates hardcoded in the shipped asset -- exiting 0,
warning about nothing, and gating on values the caller never chose.

That matters beyond the gate itself. The weak set decides the mining budget, so a
substituted threshold changes which images the iteration mines, not just which are
reported weak.

Reads the state the run already froze rather than taking the thresholds again on the
command line: a second source is a second thing to disagree with deft_state.json.

Only the run's target classes are written. ``gap_analysis`` marks an image weak when any
listed class is under its gate, so a gate for a class the run does not target would
enlarge the weak set and with it the mining budget.

Inputs:  --results-dir (reads config.ap50_thresholds and config.target_classes), --out
Output:  a YAML file with a single top-level ``weak_thresholds`` key, one entry per
         target class

Exits 1 when the state has no thresholds or no target classes, when a target class has
no gate, or when a target's gate is outside [0, 1].
