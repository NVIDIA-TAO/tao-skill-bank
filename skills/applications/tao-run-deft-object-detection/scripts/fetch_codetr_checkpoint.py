"""Resolve the Co-DETR pseudo-labelling checkpoint, downloading it if needed.

Prep labels the whole source pool with Co-DETR, and the skill has already chosen
which checkpoint it wants: ``assets/overlays/codetr_inference.yaml`` pins the ViT-L/16
geometry that only this one loads. There is exactly one right answer, so a run should
not depend on a file somebody staged by hand:

    zongzhuofan/co-detr-vit-large-coco  ->  pytorch_model.pth  (Apache-2.0, 2.8 GiB)

Stdlib only, by design. The documented alternative was ``huggingface-cli``, which is
not installable on a clean box without a virtual environment -- ``pip install --user``
is refused by ``externally-managed-environment`` -- and whose entry point has since
been renamed to ``hf``. Requiring it would also put a network-fetching package in
``deft_python.sh``'s interpreter probe, making one stage's dependency a precondition
for every run, including those that never label a pool. ``urllib`` needs nothing.

Integrity is checked rather than assumed. The architecture is pinned in the overlay,
so a checkpoint whose weights do not match loads nothing, exits 0, prints
``Execution status: PASS`` and writes one empty label file per image -- the failure
``verify_pseudo_labels.py`` exists to catch. Size and SHA-256 are verified before the
file is put in place, so that failure cannot start here.

Idempotent: an existing checkpoint at the destination is reused and nothing is
fetched, so re-running Pre-Flight on a resumed run costs nothing. Reuse checks the
size, which catches the truncated file an interrupted transfer leaves; ``--verify``
checks the digest as well, for a file that is the right size but may not be the
right checkpoint.

Inputs:  --dest, optionally --plan, --verify, --expect-sha256, --url
Output:  the checkpoint path on stdout, for the caller to capture

Exits 1 on a failed download, a size or digest mismatch, or an unwritable --dest.
