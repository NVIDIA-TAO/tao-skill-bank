# Contributing to TAO Skill Bank

Thanks for contributing! This guide covers **how we work** — trunk-based development and how CI is triggered — and the two **requirements** CI enforces on every pull request: an **SPDX license header** on source files (the `license header` hook in **Static Tests**) and **DCO sign-off** on every commit (the **DCO** workflow). See [Running the checks locally](#running-the-checks-locally) to catch failures before you push.

## Trunk-based development and backports

We practice **trunk-based development**: all changes land on **`main`** first, then are backported to release branches as needed.

- **Open your PR against `main`**, not against a `release/*` branch.
- If a fix should also ship in a release, add a **`release/X.Y.Z`** label to the PR — the label name matches the release branch (e.g. `release/7.1.0`). Add several labels to backport to multiple releases.
- When the PR merges to `main`, **`tao-cherry-pick-bot`** cherry-picks the commit onto each labeled release branch:
  - **Clean** cherry-pick → pushed straight to the release branch.
  - **Conflict** → the bot opens a **draft PR** against the release branch and assigns + @-mentions you to resolve the conflicts, then mark it ready for review.
- A summary comment on your original PR shows where each backport landed (and notes any label whose branch doesn't exist).

If you open a PR directly against a `release/*` branch, `tao-pr-bot` will remind you to retarget it to `main` and add the label. Genuinely release-only fixes — code that no longer exists on `main` — are the exception: add the **`release-only`** label to keep such a PR on the release branch.

## Running CI (the `/build` command)

For security, CI does **not** run automatically on NVIDIA's runners — it is triggered per commit.

**Internal developers**

- Comment **`/build`** on your PR to run CI (`blossom-ci`) on the latest commit.
- CI is pinned to the head commit, so **re-run `/build` after every push** — a stale run won't count.
- Make sure `blossom-ci` (and the other checks) are green before merging.

**External contributors**

- You can't trigger CI yourself. Once an internal reviewer has reviewed and vetted your PR, a maintainer will run **`/build`** for you.
- No action is needed on your side beyond addressing review feedback — just wait for the maintainer to trigger CI after the review is complete.

## License headers

Every source file must carry an **SPDX license header** near the top. Add these two lines, **below** any shebang (`#!`) line, replacing `<year>` with the current year:

```
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright (c) <year> NVIDIA CORPORATION & AFFILIATES. All rights reserved.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

Use the comment style for the file's language. The check passes as long as **both** a copyright line (`SPDX-FileCopyrightText:` or `Copyright`) **and** an `SPDX-License-Identifier:` line appear within the **first 10 lines** of the file.

**Python / shell / YAML** (an optional shebang may sit above the header):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright (c) 2026 NVIDIA CORPORATION & AFFILIATES. All rights reserved.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

**C / C++ / JavaScript / Go** (`//` comments):

```c
// SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright (c) 2026 NVIDIA CORPORATION & AFFILIATES. All rights reserved.
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

Files that legitimately cannot carry a header (e.g. generated files or data) may be listed, one repo-relative path per line, in `.github/hooks/license_header_exclude.txt`.

## Signing your work (DCO)

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```

* Already committed without a sign-off? Add one with:
  ```bash
  git commit --amend -s --no-edit      # fixes the most recent commit
  git rebase --signoff origin/main     # signs off a range of commits
  ```

* Full text of the DCO (https://developercertificate.org/):

    Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

    By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

    (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
        have the right to submit it under the open source license
        indicated in the file; or

    (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
        of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
        license and I have the right under that license to submit that
        work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
        by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
        permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
        in the file; or

    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
        person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
        it.

    (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
        are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
        personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
        maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
        this project or the open source license(s) involved.

## Running the checks locally

Both checks also run in CI, but you can catch failures before pushing:

```bash
pip install pre-commit

# check only the files your branch changed vs main:
pre-commit run --from-ref origin/main --to-ref HEAD

# or check everything:
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The `license header` and `dco-signoff` hooks (plus the lint/docstring checks) are defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Run `pre-commit install` once to have them run automatically on every `git commit`.
